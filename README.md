Overview of Project

Louise planned a fundrasier to fund her play, "Fever". As a result of the fundrasier the goal amount that was needed wasn't met. Louise is interested in finding out and understanding how other fundrasing campaigns fared. Louise has future plans of using a fundrasier to provide the necessary capital for her play. The purpose of this data is to analysis the outcomes of other campaigns and how this can benefit her in the future. 

Challenges and Difficulties

Missing data in 'cells' is a challenge that was encountered. Some campaigns had no data for 'backers' or had zeros in other cells. Formulas such as =IFERROR were used to solve this challenge.

Results

1.Based on the data from the Outcomes based on Launch Date, May is the most successful month when launching a new campaign. In May 111 campains were successful campared to 52 failed campaigns ans 3 canceled. Also, from the data we know that December is the worst month when trying to launch a new campaign. Almost 47% of campaigns launched failed in December which is easily has the highest percentage of failed campaigns. 

2.Based on the data from the Outcomes based on Goals we can conclude that campaigns with goals less than $1000 have the highest percentage of success. 71% of campaigns with a goal less than $1000 are successful. Based on the graph there is a consistent downtend when refereing to the percentage of campaigns that are a successful as the goal amount gets higher.

3.A limitation of the data is based off the market efforts of each campaign. Each campaign likely has a dirrent marketing budget, popularlity, and reach to the public. This would effect a campaign fundraiser because if certain campaign reach a greater audience than they are more likely to attract more donors. Another limitation stems from campaings from all around the world because considered as data. The value of currency fluctuates daily so this hasn't been taken into account. 

4.For the Outcomes based on Goals data the use of a pie chart would have been useful when trying to compare percentages.
